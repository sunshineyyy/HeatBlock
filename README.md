A smart heat block prototype.

 * Tackled a problem where a researcher often forgot to finish a heat block experiment on time.
 * Designed a smart heat block system involving circuit design, client-side and server-side programming.
 * Raspberry Pi with an external circuit was used to detect the temperature on heat block and control the temperature by pulse-width modulation. 
 * Javascript and HTML was used to implement the web UI of smart heat block. Node.js was used to run the web server. Data were stored in MySQL database.
